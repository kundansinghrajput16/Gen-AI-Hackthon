 GenAI-Powered Content Access & Cold Outreach Platform

## 📌 Overview

This project integrates **Generative AI** to automate two high-impact workflows:

1. **Multi-Article Intelligence from a Single Link**
2. **AI-Driven Cold Email Generation for Tech Collaborations**

The platform enables users to extract, understand, and repurpose information from web articles by simply providing a URL, and then leverage that intelligence to generate highly personalized cold emails for approaching **Big Tech companies, startups, or research organizations**.
